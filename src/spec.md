# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add external maps links so users can quickly open their trip destination and must-visit places in a maps website (e.g., for Goa or any destination).

**Planned changes:**
- Add a “Maps & Navigation” section to the Trip Plan overview that appears when the trip has one or more must-visit places.
- In “Maps & Navigation”, list each existing must-visit place with an “Open in Maps” action that opens a new tab to a URL-encoded maps search for “[Place], [Destination]”.
- Add a “View destination in Maps” action near the destination header that opens a new tab to a URL-encoded maps search for the destination string.

**User-visible outcome:** On a Trip Plan, users can open the destination in maps, and for each must-visit place they can click “Open in Maps” to search that place + destination in a new browser tab.
